    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const players_copy = players.slice()
    players_copy.push('new item')
    players_copy[2] = 'updated item'
    console.log('players_copy', players_copy)
    console.log('players', players)


    ///////////////////////// shadow copy./////////////////////
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players_copy2 = [].concat(players)
    console.log('players_copy2', players_copy2)
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players_copy3 = [...players]
    console.log('players_copy3', players_copy3)
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person_copy = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log('person_copy', person_copy)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person_copy2 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const person_deepcopy = _.cloneDeep(person)
    console.log('person_deepcopy', person_deepcopy)
